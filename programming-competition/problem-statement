You are a data analyst for a highly skilled and meticulous basketball coach.  You are in the charge of stealing away players from other teams!You are in charge of finding the best players per position.  Read a list of player stats, and print out the player with the highest average points per position.

There are four positions: "center" "forward"  "point guard" "shooting guard"

You are given a list as follows:
